To add User Email ID verification and also add send mail facility if User has forgot his/her password.You have to add your library server mail ID (that is your choice) and password in necessary place in "library server.py" code.

It is not necessary to add server mail ID and its password,it is based on your choice.

For this process, "sender_mail" will be server mail ID and "password1" will be its password.(I have also commented near them enter the details).  

<ins>Note</ins> :

You have to change the settings in server mail ID to send mail.Otherwise you might see Authenticate error or print statement saying no Internet connection. 

if your server mail ID is Gmail, Kindly turn off two step verification and go to security in your account(You can access this also from your Gmail Account->My accouht).In security tab scroll down and turn on the "Less secure app access" in that Gmail account.

It will show like below if you do the above process correctly,then it will show as below image.<br>
